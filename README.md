#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, this project converts a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, it took a design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Furthermore, a service worker has been added to beginn the process of creating a seamless offline experience for any user. 

### How to run?

Navigate to root directory and start a local webserver. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
