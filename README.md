#### _Three Stage Course Material Project - Restaurant Reviews_

## Project Overview: Stage 3

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, this project converts a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, it took a design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Furthermore, a service worker has been added to beginn the process of creating a seamless offline experience for any user. **Stage 3** wraps of the learning process of building PWAs by implementing background sync and accessible form submission to the app.

### How to run?

1. Please install GULP on your system
2. In your terminal navigate to app and install local dependencies with `npm install`. Repeat for the server directory.
3. Inside the server directory, start the backend server with `node server`.
4. Inside the app directory, build the dist files with `gulp watch`. This will also set up a local dev server on `localhost:8001`.
